## AdSense

1) Apply with your domain once DNS resolves.
2) Update `public/ads.txt` with your publisher ID line:

```
google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

3) Configure environment variables for Vite:

```
VITE_ADSENSE_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# Optional manual unit slots (after creating them in AdSense)
VITE_ADSENSE_SLOT_HERO=XXXXXXXXXX
VITE_ADSENSE_SLOT_PROGRESS=XXXXXXXXXX
VITE_ADSENSE_SLOT_RESULT=XXXXXXXXXX
```

The app auto-loads AdSense if `VITE_ADSENSE_ID` is set and renders ad units only when their slot IDs are present.
